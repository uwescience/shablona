# Open Source and Reproducible MIR Research

This repository contains the code and documentation for the tutorial on Open Source and Reproducible MIR Research, presented at [ISMIR 2018](http://ismir2018.ircam.fr/) by Thor Kell @tkell and Brian McFee @bmcfee.

The tutorial documentation, which you can read [here](https://bmcfee.github.io/ismir2018-oss-tutorial), gives a readable summary of the different parts of the tutorial, which covers:

1. Installing (development) tools
2. Setting up continuous integration services
3. Working with code and git
4. Python module organization
5. Testing
6. Documentation (sphinx)
7. The MIR ecosystem in Python
8. Next steps (further reading and resources for MIR and reproducibility)

To support the tutorial, we have developed a small library called `toymir`, which will be used for instructional purposes within the tutorial.  Attendees will modify code, add documentation, write unit tests, and learn best practices for software development work flow.

Many of the materials we present here are extended from the [shablona](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona) project, developed by Ariel Rokem at the University of Washington's eScience Institute.
